# Lab 5: Simple Key-Value Store

The purpose of this lab is to familiarize ourselves with TCP/IP networking, the client-server programming model, and thread-safe data structures.
To achieve the goal, we implement a simple server that serves as a key-value store with a custom policy.
Your server should be able to handle multiple concurrent clients (~10).

You will learn
   * how to communicate with clients using the socket API.
   * how to handle multiple readers and writers on the shared data.

```
You are assumed to know how the socket API works.
If not, we recommend you to review Beej's Guide to Network Programming (https://beej.us/guide/bgnet/) to understand each function before you start.
Specifically, calling recv() (or read()) once might not receive the entire application message for many reasons.
In the same context, calling send() (or write()) once might not send all application messgage at once.
You should always check the return value after calling recv() and send() even when handling small data.
For more details, please refer to the lecture notes related to network programming.
CSAPP 10.5 also shows a simple example of robust IO.

### RW Lock (Read-Write Lock) for many readers and writers
The RW lock is a great tool for synchronizing accesses to shared resources by multiple threads.
It allows concurrent read tasks when there is no write task, but it restricts a write task to be done exclusively.
Our rwlock.c and rwlock.h are very similar to the existing POSIX pthread_rwlock API.
If you are not familiar with the RW lock, please refer to the oracle document (https://docs.oracle.com/cd/E37838_01/html/E61057/sync-124.html) 
or IBM document (https://www.ibm.com/docs/en/aix/7.3?topic=p-pthread-rwlock-rdlock-pthread-rwlock-tryrdlock-subroutines) before you start.


## SKVS
_SKVS_ server is a simple socket-based server that serves key-value read/lookup or write/update requests from the clients.
The SKVS server repeatedly listens and accepts clients until a _SIGINT_ signal (Ctrl+C) is received.
On exit, it prints out the statistics regarding how it worked.

### Protocol
1. _SKVS_ protocol uses one connection per one client.
2. Each _SKVS_ connection runs in keep-alive mode until typing empty line (\n) or EOF (Ctrl+D) on the client.
3. _SKVS_ protocol is half-duplex. After sending request, client should wait for the response.
4. _SKVS_ protocol is text-based protocol.
5. Server should be stateful. Key-value pairs should be accessible by other clients.
6. Default service port is 8080.

### Step-by-step Operations
1. The server creates a global hash table with 4096 buckets for storing key-value entries.
   1) The global hash table should support thread-safe access to both read and write operations.
   For performance, it uses fine-grained locks, which employs a separate lock for each bucket.
2. The server creates a _listening_ socket that will be shared by all worker threads.
The default port number is 8080, but it can be adjusted by -p option.
3. The server creates a thread pool of 10 _SKVS_ worker threads.
The listening socket will be passed to the _start_routine_ of each thread as part of an _argument_.
   1) After creating the worker thread pool, the main thread waits for them to finish (by join()).
4. When a client connects to the _SKVS_ server, the responsible worker thread _accepts_ the client connection.
5. After connection establishment, the client sends a key-value command to the server.
_SKVS_ supports 5 operations: _CREATE_, _READ_, _UPDATE_, _DELETE_, and _QREAD_.
6. The responsible worker thread receives the command and parses it.
   1) For _CREATE_, it allocates a key-value entry and inserts it to the hash table.
   Then, it responds with _CREATE OK_.
   2) For _READ_, _QREAD_, it searches the responsible key-value entry and responds with the value.
   Then, it responds with the [ _value_ ].
   (We will explain the difference between _READ_ and _QREAD_ in the next section.)
   3) For _UPDATE_, it searches the responsible key-value entry and updates the value.
   Then, it responds with _UPDATE OK_.
   4) For _DELETE_, it searches the responsible key-value entry and deletes the value.
   Then, it responds with _DELETE OK_.
   5) If a key-value pair already exists, it responds with _COLLISION_ for a _CREATE_ command.
   6) For any others, it reponds with _INVALID CMD_.
   7) When the search fails, it responds with _NOT FOUND_.
   8) When any internal error occurs, it reponds with _INTERNAL ERR_.
   (It will not be evaluated.)
7. Repeat 5 ~ 6.
8. If the client feeds an empty line or EOF (e.g., by typing Ctrl+D) into the input stream, it closes the socket and serve another client (go to 4).
9. When Ctrl+C (SIGINT) is pressed on the server side, all worker threads will close.

### Requirements
Your server should serve 10 concurrent clients.
It should be able to receive or send L7 messages of arbitrary length.
There are basically 5 types of L7 messages; _CREATE_, _READ_, _UPDATE_, _DELETE_, and _QREAD_.
Your global hash table should be able to handle concurrent accesses.
To this end, you should implement custom rwlock (read-write lock) library and hash table library.
The custom RW lock is a combination of FIFO RW lock and reader-priority RW lock.
To avoid write starvation, read and write are basically handled in FIFO.
However, there is a "quick read" which is handled as in reader-priority RW lock.
It means that it preempts any other pending requests.
For example, if a read lock is held by other threads, "quick read" will immediately acquire the read lock regardless of pending threads.
Similarly, if a write lock is held by other thread, "quick read" will acquire a read lock right after the write lock is released.
Among the same "quick read" requests, the order does not matter because they are processed concurrently.
To support this "quick read" request, we add one more type, _QREAD_, over existing 4 types of L7 message.

### Scope
1. A complete implementation of the multiplexing server would require asynchronous and non-blocking socket APIs.
However, it is hard to fully grasp the concept of asynchronous networking and the implementation might be very error-prone for beginners.
For this assignment, you may implement your _SKVS_ server to handle as many concurrent flows as the number of worker threads which are statically initiated at the begining.
2. The key and value are assumed to be ASCII string.
There are many well known L7 protocols for a key-value store, such as memcached or redis, which support any binaries for a key and a value.
However, for this assignment, we simplify L7 protocol processing as much as possible.

### L7 MSG formats
1. For _CREATE_, _UPDATE_, and _DELETE_, requests should be formatted like "[ _CMD_ ] [ _key_ ] [ _value_ ]\n".
Similarly, for _READ_ and _QREAD_, the requests should be "[ _CMD_ ] [ _key_ ]\n".
2. For invalid request, SKVS server should respond "INVALID CMD\n".
3. When there is no matched key-value, SKVS server should respond "NOT FOUND\n".
4. If _CREATE_ fails due to collision, SKVS server should respond "COLLISION\n".
5. When successfully processed _CREATE_, _UPDATE_, and _DELETE_, SKVS should respond "CREATE OK\n", "UPDATE OK\n", and "DELETE OK\n", respectively.
6. When successfully processed _READ_ and _QREAD_, SKVS should respond "[ _value_ ]\n".
7. The lengths of [ _key_ ] is at most 32B.
8. The length of SKVS MSG is at most 4096B.
9. The request format, "[ _CMD_ ] [ _key_ ] [ _value_ ]\n" and "[ _CMD_ ] [ _key_ ]\n" should be handled as ASCII strings.
10. [ _CMD_ ] is **case-insensitive**, and [ _key_ ], [ _value_ ] are **case-sensitive**.
You do not need to manually parse the requests.
We provide _SKVS_ APIs such as skvs_serve() which parses the request from the given buffer and gives a well-formatted _SKVS_ response for the given request.
It returns 0 if the request is incomplete.
Otherwise, it will return 0 and write the corresponding response to wbuf.
Similarly, format issues (7 ~ 10) will be handled by skvs_serve() automatically.
For details, please refer to skvslib.c.

### Usage
```
./server -h
Usage: ./server [-p port (8080)] [-t num_threads (10)] [-d rwlock_delay (0)] [-s hash_size (1024)]
```
The parameter following -d option gives delay to rwlock_read_unlock() and rwlock_write_unlock() this is used to check semantic of your rwlock APIs.

```
./client -h
Usage: ./client [-i server_ip_or_domain (127.0.0.1)] [-p port (8080)] [-t]
```
The -t option makes the client run in interactive mode.
This is for your better understanding of _SKVS_.

### Output
```
./server
0th worker ready
1th worker ready
2th worker ready
3th worker ready
4th worker ready
5th worker ready
6th worker ready
7th worker ready
8th worker ready
9th worker ready
```

Below is an example for how to use interactive mode.
```
./client -t
Connected to 127.0.0.1:8080
Enter command: CREATE junghan enfj
Server reply: CREATE OK
Enter command: creATE seongjong entp
Server reply: CREATE OK
Enter command: create jongki esfj
Server reply: CREATE OK
Enter command: CRAETE juyoung infp
Server reply: INVALID CMD
Enter command: READ junghan
Server reply: enfj
Enter command: READ seongjong
Server reply: entp
Enter command: UPDATE seongjong cute
Server reply: UPDATE OK
Enter command: READ seongjong
Server reply: cute
Enter command: DELETE junghan
Server reply: DELETE OK
Enter command: READ junghan
Server reply: NOT FOUND
```

## Hints

### First of all, make sure your worker thread and client can communiate with each other.
Starts from writing server.c using the reference client binary.
You can use -t option on the reference client.
It will help you better understand _SKVS_ protocol.
Then, make sure your server can handle multiple concurrent clients.

### server.c
In server.c, focus on handling sockets and threads using the socket API and the pthread library.
Note that recv() and send() do not guarantee that the L7 message is completely received or sent.
You should handle the case where the L7 message is incomplete.
To be robust, your server must be able to receive or send complete L7 messages of arbitrary length at any time.

### hashtable.c
In hashtable.h, there are simple descriptions of the functions defined in hashtable.c.
Also, you should respect the usage of hash table functions by checking _SKVS_ library.
Specifically, skvs_serve() uses the functions defined in hashtable.c.
Be carefule in memory management.

### rwlock.c
In rwlock.h, there are simple descriptions of the functions defined in rwlock.c.
Also, you should respect the usage of hash table functions by checking hashtable.c file.
1) rwlock_read_lock() can get read lock only when there is no current writer.
There are two modes for rwlock_read_lock().
In quick mode, it should preempt other pending threads.
It should increase the reader counter after acquiring read lock.
If there are more readers in the pending queue, wake up them for concurrent processing.
(Or, you may use broadcasting.)
2) rwlock_read_unlock() should decrease the reader counter first and check if the reader counter is zero.
If so, it should send a signal to the oldest pending thread.
3) rwlock_write_lock() can get write lock only when there is neither reader nor writer.
It should increase the writer counter after acquiring write lock.
4) rwlock_write_unlock() should decrease the writer counter first and check if the writer counter is zero.
If so, it should send a signal to the oldest pending thread.

### C library calls
To give you some insight, we provide a list of C library calls that you might find helpful to solve this lab.
Read the man pages carefully to learn how exactly the functions operate.
